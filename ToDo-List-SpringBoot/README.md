This is a full CRUD To Do list project made with Angular and Java Spring Boot. Users are given the ability to create a task and give it a due date, importance level and name. Users are also given the ability to "finish" a task 
essentially deleting from the the database or they can update a task to change the due date, name or the importance level. There is a personal stats page that is a work in progress but users will be able to see the total number of 
tasks that they have completed, the success rate of them completing tasks on time and a whole list of completed tasks by item by importance level.
